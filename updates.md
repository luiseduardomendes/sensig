- [x] Please best use slide numbers #DONE

- [x] Please insert your names in the slide-master name field ! #DONE

- [x] Please don't use explanatory text of the template in your presentation (e.g., 'further supervisor names as applicable', modify or delete, also please choose a file name suitable to your project and names to make it unique in the collection of all semester projects.

- [x] No idea, what you mean by 'Pooling' layers in the wake of your - discussion.

- [x] Using spectrograms seems not to make sense, as you have only static (still) images of the gestures, or are you recording the wake from fist to thump up, for instance ?

- [x] I cannot find how many pictures per gesture were taken and whether more than one person was involved. Best would be person independent recognition.

- [x] Recording situation, e.g., illumination and possible variations are not addressed at all.

- [x] Based on the edge detection (remember there are more options, e.g., smoothing by Gaussian and derivation as shown in lecture), the creation of segmented regions corresponding to the hand, also denoted as blobs, and describing those blobs by various features, starting from area, perimeter, .... could be efficient here. (Python offers related methods now, too. We had in QuickCog for a long time ....)

- [x] Last not least: Please remember, that for documentation, you can as many slides as you think necessary, for presentation, however, you have to be selective and for the about 30 minutes of a group presentation commonly 25 slides are enough, less is more.
